				<h3>JSon Web Token</h3>
				<p>
					This token defines a compact and self-contained way for securely
					transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This
					information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally
					signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with HMAC algorithm) or a
					public/private key pair using RSA. Use a JSON web token for:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> This is the typical scenario for using JWT, once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. Single Sign On is a feature that widely uses JWT nowadays, because of its small overhead and its ability to be easily used among systems of different domains.</li>
            <li><strong>Information Exchange:</strong> JWTs are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties, because as they can be signed, for example using a public/private key pair, you can be sure that the sender is who they say they are. Additionally, as the signature is calculated using the header and the payload, you can also verify that the content hasn’t changed.</li>
          </ul>
				</p>
        <p>A token looks like this: <code>xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz</code></p>

        <h3>Develop, Debug and Learn</h3>
        <p>Developing is about the end-users and our actions and decision should be based around their wants. They sometimes have horrible devices and browsers and difficulties. We don't have to lose empathy for our users. Developers also need time for themselves and recognition.</p>
