        <h2>Master Mobile UX</h2>
        <p>Designing for mobile or small views is the best because it provides the best experience across many devices. Although this approach of Designing is time-consuming and costly for full rebuild, you plan for growth and address constraint of mobile bandwidth. Most people use mobile phones or tablets nowadays and this tells that this paradigm-mobile phones is here to stay and not gong to change. </p>
        <p>Lots of mobile phone users don't really know what to expect from their devices, so be there for them and reduce the cognitive load that will be on them when interacting with mobile apps. Users don't have to find it difficult to navigate websites or apps. To improve User experience, make things load fast for your users. Reduce and optimize files to help your pages load faster.</p>
        <p>Primary controls should be easy to reach. Provide descriptions for icons that most users have no idea about. Research on things you think improve user experience.</p>

        <h2>Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript</h2>
        <p>Today is the first time I am learning OOP in JS. I have a fair understanding of the concept of JS objects. OOP is a style of programing that involves the separation of code into object that have properties and methods. There are three main concept in OOP:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encapsulation-</strong>This involves keeping all the programming logic inside an object and providing methods to implement the functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>Polymorphism-</strong> In OOP, this means various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.</li>
                <li><strong>Inheritance-</strong> this means we can take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods. We can then improveon its functionality by adding new properties and methods. </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
