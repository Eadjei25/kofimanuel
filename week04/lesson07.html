				<h3>Further Functions</h3>
				<p>
					The dynamic nature of JavaScript means that a function is able to not
					only call itself, but define itself, and even redefine itself. This is
					done by assigning an anonymous function to a variable that has the
					same name as the function.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the function is also assigned to another variable, this variable
					will maintain the original function definition and not be rewritten.
					This is because the original function is assigned to a variable, then
					within the function, a variable with the same name as the function is
					assigned to a different function.
				</p>
				<h5>Recursive Functions</h5>
				<p>
					A recursive function is one that invokes itself until a certain
					condition is met. It’s a useful tool to use when iterative processes
					are involved.
				</p>
				<h5>Callbacks</h5>
				<p>
					They’re functions passed to other functions as arguments and then
					invoked inside the function they are passed to.
				</p>
				<p>
					JavaScript is a single-threaded environment, which means only one
					piece of code will ever be processed at a time. This may seem like a
					limitation, but non-blocking techniques can be used to ensure that the
					program continues to run.
				</p>
				<h5>Generalized Function</h5>
				<p>
					Callbacks can be used to build more generalized functions. Instead of
					having lots of specific functions, one function can be written that
					accepts a callback
				</p>

				<h3>CSS3 Transforms and Transitions</h3>
				<p>
					The CSS3 transform property lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or
					skew any element on the page, CSS3 gives you unprecedented control
					over many more aspects of the element’s appearance.
				</p>
				<p>
					We can manipulate an element’s appearance using transform functions.
					The value of the transform property is one or more transform functions
					(separated by spaces) that will be applied in the order they’re
					provided.
				</p>
				<section>
					<h4>Translation</h4>
					<p>
						Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or
						down. These functions are similar to the behavior of position:
						relative; when declaring top and left, moving elements up and down
						or left and right along the x and y axes.
					</p>
				</section>
				<h4>Skew</h4>
				<p>
					The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. As
					you’d expect, the x specifies the skew on the x axis, and the y
					specifies the skew on the y axis. If the second parameter is omitted,
					the skew will only occur on the x axis.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h4>Rotation</h4>
				<p>
					The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by
					a specified angle value. As with scale, by default the point of origin
					is the element’s center. Generally, angles are declared in degrees,
					with positive degrees moving clockwise and negative moving
					counterclockwise. In addition to degrees, values can be provided in
					grads, radians, or turns, but we’ll just be sticking with degrees.
				</p>

				<h3>Transitions</h3>
				<p>
					Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time,
					essentially providing simple animations. For example, if a link
					changes color on hover, you can have it gradually fade from one color
					to the other instead of a sudden change.
				</p>
				<p>
					CSS transitions are declared along with the regular styles on an
					element. Whenever the target properties change, the browser will apply
					the transition making the change gradual.
