            <h2>Forms</h2>
            <p>A form element contains form controls such as input fields, select menus and buttons.</p>
            
            <h3>Accessing Forms</h3>
            <p>Any of the DOM properties <code>document.forms</code>, <code>document.getElementsByTagName()</code> and <code>document.getElementsByClassName()</code> return an array of forms. The index notation is used to access the prefered form. Example: 
            <pre><code>const form = document.getElementsByTagname('form')[0];</code></pre></p>
            <p>Forms can also be accessed uing their name. Eg: <pre><code>const form = document.forms.search;</code></pre> or using the bracket notation: <pre><code>const form = document.forms['search'];
            </code></pre></p>
            <p>Accessing form controls or element in a form can be done using the <code>elements</code> property of the form object that returns an array of all the element in a form. Form controls can also be accessed using their name attribute value as if it was a property. This is done sing the dot or brackets notation</p> 
            <h3>Questions</h3>
            <p>The <code>form.elements</code> property does't access any other elements in the form but just the form controls. Why?</p>
            <h3>Form Properties and Methods</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><code>form.submit()</code></li>
                <li><code>form.reset()</code></li>
                <li><code>form.action()</code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>HTML attributes can be used as alternatives</p>
            <p>Reset buttons are generally considered poor for usability, as they are too easy to click and then wipe out all the data thatâ€™s been entered. So think very carefully before using one in a form</p>

            <h3>Form Events</h3>
            <p>The focus and blur events are handy when you want to change the value in a field when it is focused and bring it back when it is blurred- when not in focus</p>
            <h3>Using the formData Object</h3>
            <p>This is used to cut down the amount of code when parsing the form using JavScript.</p>
            <p>Use the name attribute for your input elements for the formData() object to work.</p>
